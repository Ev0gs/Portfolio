        I'm a French student in computer science at CESI Bordeaux, as well as a 
        skilled video game developer with experience in 2 of the most used engines Unity and UE5.
        I'm also a fan of programming languages such as C, C++, C#, as well as creating websites like this one with the help of many frameworks.         
        I'm a quick learner and often work on my missions by team to create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly games, as well as making solutions that solve real-world problems.
        Let's work together to create innovative and memorable solutions for users !
